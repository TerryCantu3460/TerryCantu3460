## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a data scientist working with Apache Hadoop to build scalable solutions for distributed data processing. This repository contains a collection of scripts, configurations, and workflow examples centered on managing large datasets, orchestrating ETL pipelines, and optimizing Hadoop clusters for real-world data challenges.

Hadoopâ€™s ecosystem empowers data teams to store, process, and analyze massive volumes of structured and unstructured data across distributed environments. My work involves harnessing tools like HDFS, MapReduce, YARN, and Hive to create high-throughput pipelines that support business intelligence, data engineering, and machine learning applications.

Handling Large Datasets: The projects in this repository showcase techniques for ingesting, transforming, and analyzing datasets at terabyte scale using MapReduce and HiveQL. Youâ€™ll find examples of log parsing, sessionization, and summarization jobs optimized for distributed processing.

Cluster Management: Efficient cluster setup and resource allocation are key to Hadoopâ€™s performance. This repo includes scripts for configuring multi-node clusters, tuning YARN and HDFS settings, and monitoring node health and job execution. Whether running on bare metal or in the cloud, the setup guides aim to ensure reliability and scalability.

ETL Pipelines: Building robust ETL workflows is at the heart of data engineering. I demonstrate how to automate extract-transform-load processes using tools like Apache Sqoop, Oozie, and shell scripting, with scheduling, logging, and fault tolerance in mind.

This repository is designed for data scientists, engineers, and system architects working with big data technologies. Each project is documented with prerequisites, setup steps, and insights into how and why each component is used.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contributeâ€”building scalable, efficient data pipelines starts with the right foundation.
